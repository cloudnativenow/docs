### Install WSL Ubuntu for Windows

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables (in ELF format) natively on Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server 2019. For Windows environments we recommend using WSL for all Bash commands. Installation is as follows:

1. Start a PowerShell

1. Install WSL for Windows

    ```
    wsl --install
    ```

  > NOTE: For more detailed instructions consult the [Microsoft WSL for Windows Install Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

1. Start a Bash Shell
