### Fork Boutique GitHub Repository

A fork is a copy of a repository so you can leverage someone else's project as a starting point for your own ideas. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original upstream repository. We are leveraging [Google's Boutique application](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) which we forked ourselves earlier under a new repository called `cassandra` where we customized it further for this site.
